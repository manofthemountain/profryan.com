      <h1>About This Blog</h1>

      <p>
        This blog is a place to think clearly about cybersecurity without marketing
        noise, tool hype, or academic abstraction for its own sake.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cybersecurity is ultimately about <strong>systems behaving under stress</strong> —
        technical systems, organizational systems, and human systems. This site
        exists to explore how those systems fail, how they’re defended, and how
        they can be designed to fail more gracefully.
      </p>

      <h2>Perspective</h2>

      <p>
        My background spans both hands-on operations and formal cybersecurity
        education. That combination shapes how topics are approached here:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Security controls are evaluated based on behavior and outcomes</li>
        <li>Architecture matters more than individual tools</li>
        <li>Visibility, logging, and response capability matter as much as prevention</li>
        <li>Tradeoffs are discussed explicitly — performance, usability, cost, and risk</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What you’ll find here</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Network and system security fundamentals</li>
        <li>Defense-in-depth and Zero Trust in practice</li>
        <li>Monitoring and logging strategies</li>
        <li>Security architecture decisions</li>
        <li>Teaching notes drawn from real coursework and labs</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What this blog is not</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>A vendor blog</li>
        <li>A news feed</li>
        <li>A certification cram site</li>
        <li>Security theater</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Updating and accuracy</h2>

      <p>
        Posts may be updated over time to reflect changes in standards, attack
        techniques, or improved explanations. When substantial updates are made,
        the post date will reflect that.
      </p>

      <h2>Intended audience</h2>

      <p>
        This blog is written for students, practitioners, and technical leaders who
        prefer understanding systems over memorizing tools.
      </p>

      <h2>About the site</h2>

      <p>
        This site is intentionally simple: static content, no CMS, minimal tracking,
        and a small attack surface. The goal is durability, clarity, and signal over
        noise.
