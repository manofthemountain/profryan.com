In late 2023, one of the largest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) campaigns in Internet history leveraged a protocol-level weakness in HTTP/2. The vulnerability — **CVE-2023-44487**, commonly known as *HTTP/2 Rapid Reset* — did not rely on amplification or bandwidth saturation.

It exploited protocol logic.

## Protocol Context: HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2 Multiplexing

HTTP/2 introduced **multiplexing**, allowing multiple concurrent request streams over a single TCP connection.

In HTTP/1.1:
- One request effectively blocks the next
- Head-of-line blocking
- Heavy reliance on multiple connections

In HTTP/2:
- Multiple independent streams per connection
- Framed messages
- Improved performance and reduced latency

Multiplexing improved performance dramatically — but it changed server-side resource accounting.

## Exploit Mechanism: RST_STREAM Abuse

HTTP/2 allows a client to cancel a request stream using the `RST_STREAM` frame.

### Normal stream lifecycle (simplified)

1. Client sends `HEADERS`
2. Stream transitions `idle → open`
3. Client sends `END_STREAM`
4. Server processes request
5. Server returns response and stream completes

### Rapid Reset behavior

1. Client sends `HEADERS`
2. Client immediately sends `RST_STREAM`
3. Server begins processing work
4. Stream closes before response delivery
5. Client immediately opens another stream

The critical insight:

> When a client cancels a stream, it instantly regains the ability to open another stream.

Because concurrency limits apply to *active* streams, rapidly closed streams allow attackers to avoid hitting thresholds while still forcing server work.

## Operational Impact: Why This Scales

This vulnerability was actively exploited between August and October 2023.

Targets included:
- Google
- AWS
- Cloudflare

Reported peaks exceeded hundreds of millions of requests per second.

Unlike volumetric DDoS attacks, Rapid Reset:
- Does not rely on bandwidth saturation
- Exploits application-layer work and request parsing
- Scales efficiently per TCP connection
- Focuses on CPU and request handling exhaustion

## Detection: What “Bad” Looks Like in Telemetry

A public testing tool was released to identify vulnerable implementations. At a high level, detection attempts to measure whether a server:
- allows rapid create/reset cycles without penalty,
- continues processing work despite immediate resets, and
- fails to terminate abusive connections.

    <h3>1. Objective</h3>

      Determine whether the service enforces effective controls against rapid create/reset stream behavior
      that can be weaponized for application-layer resource exhaustion.

    <h3>3. Interpretation</h3>
    <p>
      If the service allows continuous rapid creation and cancellation of streams without throttling, penalty,
      or connection termination, it is likely vulnerable (or functionally exposed) to Rapid Reset-style abuse.
    </p>
  </div>

## Mitigation: Protocol-Aware Controls

Effective defense requires stream-lifecycle-aware controls, not just request-rate limits.

### 1) Reset-aware rate limiting
Monitor abnormal reset-to-completion ratios and penalize excessive resets.

### 2) Stream lifetime controls
Enforce maximum streams per connection and terminate abusive connections.

### 3) Edge-level L7 protection
Use reverse proxies, adaptive filtering, and intelligent request shaping that understands HTTP/2 behavior.

Major vendors patched implementations to properly account for rapid resets and enforce connection termination under abuse conditions.


## Strategic Takeaways

CVE-2023-44487 demonstrates:

- Protocol semantics can be weaponized
- Performance optimizations expand attack surface
- Concurrency limits alone are insufficient
- Application-layer DDoS is increasingly logic-driven

Modern defense should monitor:

- Stream lifecycle behavior
- Cancellation frequency
- CPU-bound exhaustion patterns
- Application-layer economics

HTTP/2 Rapid Reset is a reminder that performance and security evolve together.
